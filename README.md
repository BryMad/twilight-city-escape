Twilight City Escape: a Homework 6 Escape Game

Twilight City Escape is a retro side-scrolling chase game written for CMSI 185. You are a rogue hero trying to outrun the corrupt Twighlight City Air Police. Use your mouse to guide your Player's escape. Click your mouse to deploy a decoy to distract the gullible air cops and make your getaway.

The game can be played at https://brymad.github.io/twilight-city-escape/

Embellishments
* scrolling, three-layer background to create parallax effect (that comes to rest at Game Over)
* sprites for player, decoy, and enemies
* enemies animate left and right
* player damage animation triggered by collision detection
* game adds additional enemies after a fixed amount of time has passed
* game adds additional, speedier “elite” enemies after a longer amount of time has passed

Future Goals
* Implement high score feature as a function of time variable
* Use collision detection/vector math to prevent agents from overlapping
* Break “elite” enemies into a separate class with their own unique sprite image
* some form of power-ups

All sprites/backgrounds are public domain and created by Luiz Zuno (https://opengameart.org/users/ansimuz).
